**Project Highlights:**

**Data Exploration and Preparation:** The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, and organization. The dataset comprises images of various big cat species, including cheetah, leopard, lion, and tiger.

**Model Training:** We have trained a RES-NET 50 model using the dataset to recognize and classify big cat species based on input images.

**Predicting Image:** A special focus of this project is on predicting lion images. The model has been fine-tuned to accurately identify lion images, and we have included a lion image to showcase the model's prediction capabilities.

Feel free to explore the code and results in this repository to learn more about the process and outcomes of our Big Cats Species Prediction project.
